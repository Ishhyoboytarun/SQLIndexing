/*
There are several types of indexes in SQL, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. 
Here are some of the most common types of indexes and when to use them:

B-tree index: A B-tree index is the most common type of index used in databases. 
It is well-suited for handling range queries, such as "find all rows where the value of column A is between X and Y". 
B-tree indexes are also efficient at handling equality queries, such as "find all rows where the value of column A is equal to X". 
B-tree indexes are typically used for columns that have a high selectivity, meaning that they have many unique values.

Here's an example of creating a B-tree index in SQL:
*/

CREATE INDEX idx_columnA ON table_name (columnA);


/*
Hash index: A hash index is optimized for handling equality queries, such as "find all rows where the value of column A is equal to X". 
Hash indexes are fast and efficient for lookups, but they are not well-suited for range queries. 
Hash indexes are typically used for columns with low selectivity, meaning that they have few unique values.

Here's an example of creating a hash index in SQL:
*/

CREATE INDEX idx_columnA ON table_name (columnA) USING HASH;


/*
Full-text index: A full-text index is used to enable text-based search queries. 
Full-text indexes are optimized for handling natural language queries, such as "find all rows that contain the word 'apple'". 
Full-text indexes are typically used for columns that contain large amounts of text data, such as articles, blog posts, or comments.

Here's an example of creating a full-text index in SQL:
*/

CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_textData ON table_name (textData);


/*
Bitmap index: A bitmap index is optimized for handling queries that involve multiple columns. 
Bitmap indexes are efficient at handling intersection and union queries, such as "find all rows where column A is X and column B is Y". 
Bitmap indexes are typically used for columns with low selectivity and for data warehouses or other applications that require complex analytical queries.

Here's an example of creating a bitmap index in SQL:
*/

CREATE BITMAP INDEX idx_columnA ON table_name (columnA);


/*
In general, it's important to choose the right type of index for your specific use case and workload. Consider the selectivity of the column, 
the type of queries that will be performed, and the overall performance requirements of your application when choosing an index type.
